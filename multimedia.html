<h1>Sorority House Dad</h1>

<h2>By Christina Hunt</h2>

<h3>Former professional baseball player and divisional President for a NASDAQ company follows his wife’s wishes to retire as sorority house parents.</h3>

<p>Here at the University of Florida, Don Gaddo is one of a kind. He is the only “house dad” for a women’s fraternity on campus. Gaddo’s formal title, which he shares with his wife Sharon, is House Manager for the Alpha Nu chapter of Phi Mu Fraternity.</p>

<p>“I understand across the country there are about 16. So if that’s the case and I’m one of 16 I’m very honored to say that I am a house dad at a women’s sorority,” Gaddo said.</p>

<p>What does a house dad do all day? Gaddo prides himself in taking care of the yard, speaking to the sorority women, discussing and planning upcoming events with his wife, taking care of the chapter’s financial budget and mediating internal problems within the household.</p>

<p>“I think that people would be surprised at what goes on behind the scenes. We’re running a business. It’s a million dollar business. We have to stay in budget. We have to speak with Housing Corporation and national officers. We have to make sure that house rules are followed. And sometimes we have to raise our voice and, maybe even for effect, pound the fist to get a point across. But I think it may surprise people to know that at the end of the day or at the end of an entire year you walk away more filled than you did the day before or the year before,” Gaddo said.</p>

<p>After 17 years as a house dad, Gaddo has watched hundreds of young women—women that become his daughters— “cast their nets” and succeed as businesswomen, wives and mothers.</p>

<p>“We’re like a family, if you stop and think about it. They call us a sorority; they call this a chapter house. But we call it a chapter home. And like any home we have our good points. We have our bad points. We have our problems. But most of all we have a lot of joy and we celebrate,” Gaddo said.</p>
